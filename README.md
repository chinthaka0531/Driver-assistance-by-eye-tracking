# Driver assistance by eye tracking

This code has the ability to detect the face and the pupil. If the person's pupil is not centered this will trigger an alarm. There are two python scripts. One is for windows and the other one is for Raspberry pi. 

Just clone the repo and install requirements. If you are having difficulties when installing dlib you can follow [this](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/01/22/install-dlib-easy-complete-guide/) tutorial by  Adrian Rosebrock

After you can run the main_raspberry.py or main_windows.py

Note: This project has been implemented based on the [this](https://github.com/antoinelame/GazeTracking)  repository by antoinelame. 
I want to thank him for his great work.

Thank you
